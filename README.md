# EOTE Theme for Trilium Notes

_Inspired by the GitHub dark dimmed website style._

To me, such styles make the content more readable and are good for productive use with low eye strain.

## Installation

- Create a new note inside your Trilium Notes and set the Note Type to `CSS`
- Copy the content of the themes `.css` file inside the Note you just created
- Add the label `#appCss`
  - You can do that in the `Owned Attributes` on the top of your note <kbd>Alt+A</kbd>
  - If are currently using other custom themes, make sure the theme you intend to use is the only one with the `#appCss` label
- Reload <kbd>Ctrl+R</kbd>

_I'm not a big Trillium user anymore, since I moved all my coding and knowledge management to neovim. But I will do my best to implement improvements and fixes. If I can help in any way, feel free to leave me a message._
